    <div class="container main-text">
        <p class="lead text-center text-md-left text-muted">An aortic aneurysm is an abnormal bulge that occurs in the wall of the major blood vessel (aorta) that carries blood from your heart to your body. Aortic aneurysms can occur anywhere in your aorta and may be tube-shaped (fusiform) or round (saccular).</p>
        <p class="lead text-center text-md-left text-muted">Aortic aneurysms include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="lead text-center text-md-left text-muted">Abdominal aortic aneurysm. An abdominal aortic aneurysm occurs along the part of the aorta that passes through the abdomen</li>
          <li class="lead text-center text-md-left text-muted">Thoracic aortic aneurysm. A thoracic aortic aneurysm occurs along the part of the aorta that passes through the chest cavity.</li>
        </ul> 
        <p class="lead text-center text-md-left text-muted">In some cases, an individual may have an abdominal aortic aneurysm and a thoracic aortic aneurysm.</p>
        <p class="lead text-center text-md-left text-muted">Having an aortic aneurysm increases your risk of developing an aortic dissection.</p>
        <p class="lead text-center text-md-left text-muted">We offer the best treatment of Aortic repair i.e Endovascular aneurysm repair which involves inserting a graft within the aneurysm through small groin incisions using X-rays to guide the graft into place.</p>
        <p class="lead text-center text-md-left text-muted">The advantage of this type of repair is that there is no abdominal surgery. This technique is therefore safer than the traditional operation, and you need to spend less time in hospital. A disadvantage is that some patients have to undergo a further operation at a later stage to refine the initial procedure.</p>

People having any coronary heart problem Blood flows from our heart to various parts of our body via blood vessels called arteries. Similarly, the vessels which transport blood back to heart are called veins. Peripheral Vascular Disease is a blood circulation disorder in which blood flow outside of our heart via blood vessels is reduced or blocked. Such blockage can happen both with arteries or veins however since mostly the same is observed in arteries, PVD is also referred to as Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD). PVD is the most common disease of the arteries. The blockage of arteries h appens due to Arteriosclerosis i.e. hardening of arteries due to plaque formation in the arteries or blockage can also happen due to blood vessel spasms. In Arteriosclerosis, the plaque growth slowly inside the arteries increases and may ultimately completely block the artery resulting in organ damage, if left untreated. While PVD is mostly observed in legs, it may also developin blood vessels supplying blood to your other body parts like arms, kidneys etc.</p>
