People having any coronary heart problem Blood flows from our heart to various parts of our body via blood vessels called arteries. Similarly, the vessels which transport blood back to heart are called veins. Peripheral Vascular Disease is a blood circulation disorder in which blood flow outside of our heart via blood vessels is reduced or blocked. Such blockage can happen both with arteries or veins however since mostly the same is observed in arteries, PVD is also referred to as Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD). PVD is the most common disease of the arteries. The blockage of arteries h appens due to Arteriosclerosis i.e. hardening of arteries due to plaque formation in the arteries or blockage can also happen due to blood vessel spasms. In Arteriosclerosis, the plaque growth slowly inside the arteries increases and may ultimately completely block the artery resulting in organ damage, if left untreated. While PVD is mostly observed in legs, it may also developin blood vessels supplying blood to your other body parts like arms, kidneys etc.</p>
