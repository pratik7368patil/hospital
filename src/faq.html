            <h5 class="question">What is interventional radiology?</h5>
            <p>
              Interventional radiology is an advanced treatment alternative to
              traditional surgery. Through a tiny incision in your skin,
              interventional radiologists are able to deliver precise treatment
              for common and life-threatening conditions. Because interventional
              radiology is less invasive than surgery, patients often experience
              quicker recovery and, in many cases, more effective results.
            </p>
            <p>
              With minimized risk and pain compared to surgery, interventional
              radiology leverages advanced imaging techniques, such as
              ultrasounds, X-rays, and MRI scans, to see inside your body and
              treat a variety of conditions, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cancer</li>
              <li>Peripheral vascular disease</li>
              <li>Varicose veins</li>
              <li>Kidney failure</li>
              <li>Liver disease</li>
              <li>Uterine fibroids</li>

            <h5 class="question">
              How is interventional radiology different than surgery?
            </h5>
            <p>
              Unlike traditional surgery, interventional radiology requires only
              a tiny incision the size of a pinhole. That means less pain for
              patients—and a faster recovery. Most interventional radiology
              procedures can be completed in an outpatient setting, allowing
              many patients to go home the same day they receive treatment. If a
              hospital stay is necessary, patients are often discharged within
              24 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
              Interventional radiology procedures have been proven to result in
              similar outcomes—or at times—significantly better outcomes than
              traditional open surgery. In fact, for certain treatments,
              interventional radiology has replaced traditional open surgery.

            <h5 class="question">
              Will I be awake during my interventional radiology procedure? Will
              I receive general anesthesia?
            </h5>
            <p>
              Unlike traditional surgery, patients undergoing interventional
              radiology procedures generally do not receive general anesthesia.
              Since general anesthesia isn’t typically necessary for
              interventional radiology procedures, you’ll benefit from a quicker
              recovery and less risk of complications.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead, your care team will generally numb the incision area with
              a local anesthetic to minimize discomfort. Then they will use an
              intravenous (IV) line to deliver sedation, which will make you
              more comfortable and relaxed during your procedure. You can rest
              easy knowing that you will feel minimal pain.

              Are the Interventional Radiology procedures covered under health
              Insurance?
            </h5>
            <p>
              Yes, Interventional procedures unlike anyother traditional surgery
              are covered under insurance as per your plan.

              Second opinions are not uncommon. Discuss your desire for another
              opinion with your doctor or if you are looking for a second
              opinion kindly approach US through booking an appointment.
